## Animal Sanctuary Project

#### Week 2 - Homework - Skill Distillery

### Overview

* The program simulates an animal sanctuary. The Animal Sanctuary App class is the only class with a main, and acts as the "controller" to run through the app's options. This week's homework focused on gaining familiarity with APIE (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation). 

### How to Run:

* After running the program, the user will have 4 options while traversing through the "app" - list animals, add a new animal, start the attendant's rounds (which goes around feeding the animals) and quit. 

### Technologies Used:

* APIE
* UML Class Diagram
* "IS-A" vs. "HAS-A" relationships. 

### Lessons Learned: 

* UML Class Diagram - How important these can be while trying to map out how you would like the program to function. In our case, I was very happy with being provided one, rather than trying to draw one up myself.
